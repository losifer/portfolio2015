                            Deluxe Distribution offers many contests throughout the year. Spitfire Wheels happnes to host many. This contest in particular required skateboarders to post videos to their instagram accounts which were then tagged, viewed, and judged by professional team riders. The winner got a year sponsorship from the company.

                            <h4>The problem</h4>
                            <p class="text-left">
                            Displaying all this information plus showcasing the videos in a clean and orderly fashion that doesn't sacrifice the brand.
                            </p>
                            <h4>The solution</h4>
                             <p class="text-left">
                            While this could have been broken up into several pages, a single view page made it easy to get information to the viewer without further action. Graphics were considerably minimal with the biggest files set as background to allow for quick download of content. Videos were hosated on instagram and embeded requiring little coding work.

                            <h3>The process</h3>
                            <p class="text-left">Designing in the browser for fast results. While at times, this has proved to be more of an effort, in this case, using CSS to create the basic look and feel and flush out any extra non-important elements could be added later. The desktop page was also considerably small with little scrolling. The mobile was a bit tricky, but working on designing within the browser allowed for figuring out breakpoints for graphic art direction. We also had to figure out the best way to scale embeded Instagram videos.

                            <p class="text-left">
                            The end result, a nicely laid out page with good content flow. The interest of  content to the user drives the scrolling. THe visual design of the hero with acknowledgement to the content below cues the user to scroll for more information. The headline clearly defines to the user that below the fold lies the prize.
