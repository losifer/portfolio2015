                            <h3>The Story</h3>
                            <p class="text-left">
                            One of the most difficult things at Deluxe Distribution has always been how to streamline the catalog process. The company takes so much pride in their art department as well as their staff photographer's work. and one way they would show it off was through its printed catalogs. They even served up a catalog camp every season. The printed catalog was discontinued, but a new medium has taken over. We had to seamlessly work with print designers in order to work their ideas for online translation for desktop and mobile.

                            <h4>The problem</h4>
                            <p class="text-left">
                            The transition is a variable, with many elements that could distract the workflow. Branding plays a key part in showcase, but also begins to add a layer of overbearing graphic assets , specifically on mobile. Also trying to convince esigners that are not used to minimal design aesthetics has proved to be a difficult task.

                             <p class="text-left">
                            The main objective is to translate our brands through the products without screaming. Let the product spean for itslef and add cohesiveness to the overall design. A second objective which has proved successfull has been ysabuility and repurposing. What was once a time consuming process has been cut down to a fraction of the time spent on production and development

                            The guid below aims at helping designers prioritize the products and spend less time on branding elements. This should streamline their creative process, prevent time consuming art direction, and get these catalogs out the door faster than has been the case. It aims at clearly defined goals for legibility for both mobile and desktop.

                            One thing that has made an impact with using this format has been our lookbooks. The photography drives a set of products over a tour with one of our teams. It gives the lookbook a story through the brand.
